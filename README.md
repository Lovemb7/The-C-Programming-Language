# The C Programming Language
**Repository is dedicated to the book *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan and Ritchie.**
1. You can find all listing and exercises from the book.
2. To run any code on UNIX-like operating systems, simply write 
`gcc <filename.c>` 
inside the exercise or listing folder, where `filename` corresponds to the file in which the main function is provided.
3. Programs with multiple files can be run by executing the `make` command if the Makefile is inside a folder.
